**Fixes:**
* Support for arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios
* Proper UI fixes, including proper window scaling and scaling of visual filters (like brightness)

## Installation
* Extract the [latest release](https://github.com/jshethbright/AINirvanaUltrawideFix/releases) to the root of the game directory.
    * For Steam, this can be located by right-clicking the game in the library bar -> Manage -> Browse local files.
* Run the game (this will take a while on the first run as MelonLoader needs to install).

## Configuration
* Edit the generated config file at the root of the game directory, in the **Mod** folder.

## Usage
* Run the game!
* Combine this mod with [SpecialK's framerate limiter](https://wiki.special-k.info/) for a smoother experience.

## Known Issues
* When using a controller, the game cursor is bound to a 16:9 rectangle.
